This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates the use of functions, conditionals, and user input. 
The program defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that applies a discount only if it is 20% or greater. 
Otherwise, it returns the original price. 

Users are prompted to enter the original price of an item and a discount percentage. 
The program then prints the final price after applying the discount, or the unchanged price if no discount is applied.

This project is suitable for beginners learning Python basics such as:
- Defining and calling functions
- Using conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- Handling user input
- Basic arithmetic operations
